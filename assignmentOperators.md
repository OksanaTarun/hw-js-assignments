## Assignment Operators 

Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables.

* Operator:

> =	
The Simple Assignment Operator assigns a value to a variable.

> += 
The Addition Assignment Operator adds a value to a variable.

> -=	
The Subtraction Assignment Operator subtracts a value from a variable.

> *=
The Multiplication Assignment Operator multiplies a variable.

> /=	
The Division Assignment Operator divides a variable.

> %=	
The Reminder Assignment Operator assigns a remainder to a variable.

> **=	
The Exponentiation Assignment Operator raises a varable to the power of the operand.

* Shift Assignment Operators:

> '<<='
The Left Shift Assignment Operator left shifts a variable.

> '>>='
The Right Shift Assignment Operator right shifts a variable (signed).

> '>>>='
The Unsigned Right Shift Assignment Operator right shifts a variable (unsigned).

* Bitwise Assignment Operators:

> &=
The Bitwise AND Assignment Operator does a bitwise AND operation on two operands and assigns the result to the variable.

> ^=
The Bitwise XOR Assignment Operator does a bitwise XOR operation on two operands and assigns the result to the variable.

> |= 
The Bitwise OR Assignment Operator does a bitwise OR operation on two operands and assigns the result to the variable.

* Logical Assignment Operators:

> &&=  
The Logical AND assignment operator is used between two values. If the first value is true, the second value is assigned.

> ||=  
The Logical OR assignment operator is used between two values. If the first value is false, the second value is assigned.

> ??=  
The Nullish coalescing assignment operator is used between two values. If the first value is undefined or null, the second value is assigned.

## Increment

The increment operator (++) increments (adds one to) its operand and returns the value before or after the increment, depending on where the operator is placed.

If used postfix, with operator after operand (for example, x++), the increment operator increments and returns the value before incrementing.

If used prefix, with operator before operand (for example, ++x), the increment operator increments and returns the value after incrementing.

## Decrement

The decrement operator (--) decrements (subtracts one from) its operand and returns the value before or after the decrement, depending on where the operator is placed.

If used postfix, with operator after operand (for example, x--), the decrement operator decrements and returns the value before decrementing.

If used prefix, with operator before operand (for example, --x), the decrement operator decrements and returns the value after decrementing.
