## Assignment Operators 

Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables.

* Operator:

> =	
The Simple Assignment Operator assigns a value to a variable.

> += 
The Addition Assignment Operator adds a value to a variable.

> -=	
The Subtraction Assignment Operator subtracts a value from a variable.

> *=
The Multiplication Assignment Operator multiplies a variable.

> /=	
The Division Assignment Operator divides a variable.

> %=	
The Reminder Assignment Operator assigns a remainder to a variable.

> **=	
The Exponentiation Assignment Operator raises a varable to the power of the operand.

* Shift Assignment Operators:

> '<<='
The Left Shift Assignment Operator left shifts a variable.

> '>>='
The Right Shift Assignment Operator right shifts a variable (signed).

> '>>>='
The Unsigned Right Shift Assignment Operator right shifts a variable (unsigned).

* Bitwise Assignment Operators:

> &=
The Bitwise AND Assignment Operator does a bitwise AND operation on two operands and assigns the result to the variable.

> ^=
The Bitwise XOR Assignment Operator does a bitwise XOR operation on two operands and assigns the result to the variable.

> |= 
The Bitwise OR Assignment Operator does a bitwise OR operation on two operands and assigns the result to the variable.

* Logical Assignment Operators:

> &&=  
The Logical AND assignment operator is used between two values. If the first value is true, the second value is assigned.

> ||=  
The Logical OR assignment operator is used between two values. If the first value is false, the second value is assigned.

> ??=  
The Nullish coalescing assignment operator is used between two values. If the first value is undefined or null, the second value is assigned.
